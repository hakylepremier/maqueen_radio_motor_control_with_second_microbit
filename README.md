# Maqueen Lite Motor Control with Radio using External Microbit

This is a project that I built to help me control my Maqueen robot through radio connection with another microbit. Therefore I use one microbit to control another that is connected to the Maqueen robot. This project mostly controls just the motors but you can extend it to allow you to control the servos, LEDs and distance sensors if you want.

## Requirements

- [Maqueen Lite (with micro:bit V2)](https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1872.html)
- [micro:bit v2](https://microbit.org/buy/bbc-microbit-go/): Get the one with the battery pack for easy of use.
